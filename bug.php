This code suffers from a race condition.  The `check_and_update` function isn't atomic; there's a window between checking the value of `$counter` and updating it where another process could also increment it, leading to an incorrect count.  This is especially problematic in a multi-threaded or multi-process environment.

```php
<?php

$counter = 0;

function check_and_update() {
  global $counter;
  if ($counter < 10) {
    sleep(1); // Simulate some work
    $counter++;
  }
}

for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
  check_and_update();
}

echo "Counter: " . $counter;
?>
```
